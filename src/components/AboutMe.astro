      I'm Chenglong Wu, a gratuate student in Computer Science at Illinois Institute of Tecnology specializing in <strong
        >Software Engineering and AI such as Generative AI, LLMs, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Reinforment Learning and Computer Vision</strong
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some of the recent achievements that I am proud of was participating in a  <strong
        >Hackathon called Orahacks;</strong> where we became <strong> victorious in one of the categories with prize pool against more than 100 developers</strong
      >. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Some of my hobbies are playing sports and videogames, specially team based videogames/sports such as League of Legends. </p>
    <p>
      You guys may wonder why I mention this, it is because I have been placing among the top 8000 players in North America shows years of detication to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>🎯 Perfecting my plays through constant practice and analysis</li>
      <li>🧠 Developing complex strategies to outmaneuver opponents</li>
      <li>🏆 Leading my team effectively, both in-game and during planning</li>
      <li>💪 Maintaining a never-give-up attitude, even in challenging matches</li>
      <li>🤝 Embracing a teamwork-first mindset as a support role player</li>
  </ul>
  &nbsp;
  <p>
    Beyond these, my journey to Master tier in League of Legends has taught me valuable skills that translate to professional settings:
  </p>
  <ul>
      <li>⚡ Rapid decision-making under pressure</li>
      <li>🔄 Adapting quickly to evolving situations</li>
      <li>💬 Effective communication in high-stakes environments</li>
      <li>📚 Continuous learning and staying updated with meta changes</li>
      <li>🧘 Mental resilience and emotional control</li>
  </ul>
  &nbsp;
  <p>
    Reaching this level in League of Legends requires a combination of individual skill, strategic thinking, and the ability to work seamlessly within a team - qualities that are equally valuable in the professional world.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m excited to bring my skills and experiences to my professional endeavors. As the co-captain of my university's League of Legends Varsity Team, I want to thank my teammates for their warm welcome when I arrived in the U.S. Their support has not only strengthened our team dynamics but also helped me improve my communication skills as a player and leader.
